<details>
  <summary>running with arguments</summary>
type this in your terminal:

</details>

# how do i run it?
open main.py and change `target = 10000` to `target = 5` or any number you wish (line 8 in main.py).

then, run main.py, it should spit out a lot of numbers, depending on how big your number is, the longer it will take.
when it is done, it will save to /sorting_logs/sort_(target)_(random_number).txt for you to see the amount of sorts it took, target, shuffled array and final array.

feel free to edit this and play around with it! have fun!
